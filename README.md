# Chess AI
This repo contains my own personal chess tooling and other code. The latest version is based around the Stockfish chess engine.

### Status
This code plays two AI BestBots against each other. An AI BestBot always chooses the best move according to the stockfish engine.

### Run Tests
```./scripts/test.sh```

### Run Code
```./scripts/run.sh```

### Move Format
Moves should be formated using lowercase letters with no spaces (Ex: e2e4)
